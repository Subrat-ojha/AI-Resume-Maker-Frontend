UI/UX Design Inspiration for AI Resume Maker Website

Context:
I am building an AI-powered resume maker web application where users enter prompts and the system generates professional resumes automatically. I am responsible for the backend/AI logic but I do not have UI/UX or frontend design expertise.

Primary Reference:
I want to take design inspiration from the website: https://www.hume.ai/

Objectives:

Understand visual structure: Layout, navigation, spacing, consistency, and hierarchy.

Extract UI patterns: Hero section, call-to-action buttons, form interactions, iconography, content cards, typography, color schemes.

Adapt for my use case: Translate those patterns to a UI for an AI resume maker (landing page, input prompt UI, wizard/flow, output display).

Deliverables:

Moodboard / Style Guide inspired by hume.ai

Low-fi wireframes for key screens

Hi-fi mockups (desktop + mobile)

Component library recommendations (buttons, forms, cards, modals)

Responsive layout guidelines

Target Users:
Job seekers of all levels (students, professionals, career switchers)

Key Pages to Design:

Landing Page – value proposition, features, testimonials, CTAs

Prompt Input Page – friendly UI asking for resume details or free-text prompt

Processing/Feedback Screen – progress state while AI generates resume

Resume Output Page – final generated resume preview + download/extend actions

Dashboard (optional) – saved resumes, history, templates

Design Requirements & Tone:

Clean, modern, minimal

Professional but approachable

Trust-building with subtle animations

Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Consistent UI language

Specific Features from hume.ai to Adapt:

A well-structured hero section with clear CTAs

Use of iconography to explain features

Consistent color palette with accent highlights

Simple navigation

Section transitions that guide the user through value propositions

Constraints:

Must be easy for developers to implement (using TailwindCSS/React preferred)

Must be responsive from mobile to desktop

Deliver final files in:

Figma or Adobe XD

Exportable design system (color tokens, typography scales, spacing rules)
